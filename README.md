# Project 1: CatPhotoApp - Responsive Web Design (FCC)
##### This repository contains the completed code for the first project in the FreeCodeCamp "Responsive Web Design" course. 

The project showcases fundamental HTML by building a simple web page for a fictional cat photo application.

## Project Overview

The **CatPhotoApp** demonstrates the basics of HTML5 and CSS3, while focusing on responsive design principles. The project includes images, links, forms, and lists, all structured semantically to create a user-friendly experience.

### Key Features

- **Basic HTML Structure**: The project uses common HTML tags to create sections like headers, footers, and body content.
- **Interactive Links and Images**: The page contains interactive elements such as links to external websites and images with `alt` attributes for accessibility.
- **Unordered and Ordered Lists**: It features both unordered and ordered lists to display information in an easy-to-read format.
- **Forms with Input Fields**: Users can input data through radio buttons, checkboxes, and text fields, which are handled by a form submission process.
- **Use of Semantic Elements**: The project incorporates semantic HTML tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, and `<main>` to improve both readability and SEO.
- **Figures and Captions**: The images are complemented with `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements to provide context and additional information about the images.
  
## Code Details

- The project includes three primary sections:
  1. **Cat Photos**: This section introduces users to the cat photo gallery, with a link and a featured image.
  2. **Cat Lists**: A detailed description of things cats love and hate, presented through unordered and ordered lists.
  3. **Cat Form**: A form where users can specify their cat's characteristics and submit a cat photo URL.

### Project Layout

- **Header**: Contains the title of the app.
- **Sections**:
  - **Cat Photos**: Displays a featured cat image with a link to more cat photos.
  - **Cat Lists**: Displays lists of things cats love and hate, with images and captions.
  - **Cat Form**: A simple form for users to submit details about their cat, including its personality and whether it's an indoor or outdoor cat.
- **Footer**: Includes a "No Copyright" message and a link to FreeCodeCamp.
